# Python-Db-Importer

This project was created when I needed to import different formats of csv files,
with varying columns, into existing mysql tables.

I would like to extend this project to not only read csv files, but also excel,
openxml, and other varying file formats.

The original base of the code is from http://128.174.125.122/wiki/index.php/Python_script_for_loading_CSV_to_mySQL .

#Installation

Just clone the repository, and run the import.py file.
It requires the python-mysqldb package, to install that:
`sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb`

#Contact

Contact me using github on any issues or questions.

Thank you.
